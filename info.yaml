  top_module: "tt_um_muncherkin_lioncage" # Put the name of your top module here, must start with "tt_um_". Make it unique by including your github username

  # How many tiles your design occupies? A single tile is about 167x108 uM.

# As everyone will have access to all designs, try to make it easy for someone new to your design to know what
# it does and how to operate it. This info will be automatically collected and used to make a datasheet for the chip.
